# Introduction

With the emergence of deep learning, machine learning has gained immense popularity in recent years. Deep learning has been effectively applied to a diverse range of problems, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, among others. Due to its immense potential, the number of individuals seeking to pursue this field has significantly increased. However, for those lacking any prior knowledge in deep learning or machine learning, the initial phase can be quite challenging. To address this, we have compiled the first edition of this book to provide readers with a comprehensive introduction to deep learning.

The book comprises eight chapters. The introductory chapter provides an overview of deep learning. In chapter 2, we delve into the basic mathematical concepts essential for machine learning, specifically deep learning. Chapter 3 encompasses classical machine learning concepts that form the foundation for understanding deep learning. Chapter 4 delves into the workings of deep learning, including what it is and how it operates. Chapter 5 explores the concepts of overfitting (high variance) and underfitting (high bias) and how to mitigate them. In chapter 6, readers are introduced to the process of structuring a machine learning project. The final chapters entail two applications of deep learning, specifically the convolutional neural network model and sequence models.
